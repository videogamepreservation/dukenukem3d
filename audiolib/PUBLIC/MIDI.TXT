Apogee Sound System MIDI notes:
-------------------------------

FM Midi :

On OPL2 cards 9 voices are available.  OPL3 cards have 18 voices.  Melodic
mode is used for music.  For percussion (channel 10), each key is assigned
a timbre to play at a pitch specified by the patch.  This method was chosen
based on the advice of Bobby Prince, Rob Wallace, George Sanger, and Lee
Jackson, all of whom felt the 11 voice mode was too restricting for
musicians.

Channels 1-16 are now supported.
