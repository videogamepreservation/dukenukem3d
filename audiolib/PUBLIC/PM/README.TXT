Here's a quick explanation of the files included in this zip file:

  README.TXT : This file
      PM.TXT : A quick explanation of the PM.EXE midi player
      PM.EXE : PM - a command line midi file player
 MAKETMB.EXE : this generates TMB files for use by PM.  Read GMTIMBRE.INI
GMTIMBRE.TMB : A timbre file generated by MAKETMB
GMTIMBRE.INI : An example timbre script for MAKETMB.  Generates GMTIMBRE.TMB
  PERCUS.IBK : General MIDI percussion instruments.  Used by GMTIMBRE.INI
 GENMIDI.IBK : General MIDI percussion instruments.  Used by GMTIMBRE.INI
 TIMBRES.ZIP : A couple sets of instrument banks that can be used as
               source material for fm instruments.


MAKETMB is a simple utility to allow developers to develop and use their
own FM instrument banks with the Apogee Sound System.  It can generate
either a data file or source code (ask me if you'd prefer to use this
feature) containing the instruments and usable by the sound system.

The benefit of having the instruments in a data file is that multiple files
could be made, each with instruments specific to a particular song or set
of songs.  It also allows you to make quick changes to the instruments and
hear them in a song (using PM) very quickly, without having to recompile
the code (very useful for musicians).

I know I'm terrible at writing documentation, so if these files are a little
vague, give me a call and I'll walk you through it.
