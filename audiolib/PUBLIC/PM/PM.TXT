PM is a quick and dirty file player for DOS using the Apogee Sound System.

If you type PM with no arguments you'll get the following information:

PM Version 1.10 by Jim Dos‚
Usage: PM [ midifile ] CARD=[ card number ] MPU=[ port address in hex ]
          TIMBRE=[ timbre file ]

   card number =
      0 : General Midi
      1 : Sound Canvas
      2 : Awe 32
      3 : WaveBlaster
      4 : SoundBlaster
      5 : Pro AudioSpectrum
      6 : Sound Man 16
      7 : Adlib
      8 : Ensoniq SoundScape
      9 : Gravis UltraSound

So, if you want to play FANFARE.MID on a Sound Canvas at port 330h, type:
   PM Fanfare.mid card=1 mpu=330

The TIMBRE parameter tells PM to use the MAKETMB generated timbre file
specified.  This is useful when you're testing new timbres and want to
see how they sound.

You can also set an environment variable that has the card settings you
want to use by default and PM will use it.  Just type "SET PM=<card>,<mpu>"
where <card> is the card number and <mpu> is the address of the MIDI card
(if any).  So for a Sound Canvas at port 330h, you would use "SET PM=1,330".
Then you can just type "PM Fanfare.mid" on the command line to play your
song without worrying about the card and mpu parameters.

If you have any problems or questions, call me at (214)-271-1365 ext. 221.
