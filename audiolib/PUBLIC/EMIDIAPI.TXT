| I.  Instrument Definitions                                |
=============================================================

The following instruments are currently defined as valid for data
entry events:

        0 -     General MIDI
        1 -     Roland Sound Canvas (GM and GS)
        2 -     Sound Blaster AWE32
        3 -     Wave Blaster and Compatibles (SCD-10, etc.)
        4 -     Sound Blaster and Compatibles (OPL-2 and OPL-3)
        5 -     Media Vision Pro Audio series
        6 -     Logitech Sound Man 16
        7 -     Adlib and Compatibles
        8 -     Ensoniq Soundscape
        9 -     Gravis Ultrasound, Ultrasound Max, Ultrasound ACE
        127 -   All (see Controller Definitions)


=============================================================
| II.  Controller Definitions                                |
=============================================================

The following controllers are currently defined as valid:

110 -   Track Designation
        Required:               Yes
        Multiples allowed:      Yes
        Format:                 110 nn
                                (where nn is a defined instrument)

Controller 110 determines which instruments will receive data for
this track.  Multiple instances may be used to designate multiple
instruments.  If the track is designated for all instruments,
Instrument 127 may be used.  This instrument may also be used in
conjunction with Controller 111 to exclude a single instrument or
group of instruments.


111 -   Track Exclusion
        Required:               No
        Multiples allowed:      Yes
        Format:                 111 nn
                                (where nn is a defined instrument -
                                        instrument 127 is invalid)

Controller 111 excludes an instrument from receiving the data for
this track.  Multiple instances may be used to exclude multiple
instruments.  Instrument 127 is not valid for this controller.


112 -   Program Change
        Required:               No
        Multiples allowed:      Yes
        Format:                 112 nn
                                (where nn is a GM program change)

Controller 112 is the same as the standard MIDI program change
event.  It may be inserted at any point a program change is
required.  If it does not exist, standard MIDI program change events
will be recognized for this track.  If it does exist, standard MIDI
program change events will not be recognized for this track, and all
program changes for the track must be entered using Controller 112.


113 -   Volume
        Required:               No
        Multiples allowed:      Yes
        Format:                 113 nn
                                (where nn is between 0 and 127)

Controller 113 allows different volumes to be inserted in the same
manner as Controller 7.  It should be used only if
designation/exclusion groups exist on the same MIDI channel.  If
Controller 113 does not exist at the beginning of the track,
Controller 7 events will be recognized.  If Controller 113 does
exist at the beginning of the track, Controller 7 events will be
ignored.


116 -   Loop Begin
        Required:               Yes
        Multiples allowed:      Yes (see below)
        Format:                 116 nn
                                (see below for definition)

Controller 116 indicates the beginning of a sequence to be looped.
Values for this controller are as follows:

        0 - infinite loop
        1 - loop once
        2 - loop twice
        x - loop x times

A song should have a Master Start point and a Master End point.  The
start point should occur after the InitBeat (see section III) and
after any introduction you wish to have played only once.  Any
controller information (patch changes, pitch bend info, etc.)
required for the loop should be entered and/or repeated after the
loop's Master Start event (see also Section III, "InitBeat", below).
Likewise, any "reset" events required should be entered either just
after the loop's Master Start event or just before the loop's Master
End event.

Multiple non-infinite loop start/end pairs (see Controller 117
below) may occur at any point inside the Master Loop.  Only one
infinite loop may be defined per song.  Nested loops are not yet
supported.

IMPORTANT:  Any event to be included within the loop must fall after
            the Loop Begin point and end before the Loop End point.
            If you are using Cakewalk Pro for Windows, you can
            verify this by looking at the Event List view.
            SIMULTANEOUS TIMES FOR LOOP POINTS AND EVENT DATA DO NOT
            GUARANTEE THAT AN EVENT IS INSIDE THE LOOP.  If in
            doubt, set the event one tick after the Loop Begin or
            have it end one tick before the Loop End.


117 -   Loop End
        Required:               Yes
        Multiples allowed:      Yes (see below)
        Format:                 117 127

Controller 117 indicates the end of a looped segment of a song, or
in the case of a Master Loop, the end of the entire song.  This
controller signals that the Apogee Sound System should immediately
loop back to the nearest non-resolved loop begin event (i.e., the
nearest Controller 116 event that does not have a matching
Controller 117 event).

Loop End events should not occur at the exact time of a Loop Begin
event.

Note:  Loop Begin/End pairs only affect the track they are placed
       on.  If an entire song is to be looped through a segment, all
       tracks must contain Loop Begin events and Loop End events
       which occur on the same tick across all tracks.  Be careful
       how you use non-synchronous single track loops - the composer
       is responsible for making sure that everything stays in sync.

See Controller 116 above for important information regarding
placements of events to be included within loops.


=============================================================
| III.  InitBeat Format                                     |
=============================================================

Each song should begin with an InitBeat.  In terms of standard
musical notation, an example of this would be a single 1/4 measure
where the rest of the song is in 4/4, or a single 1/8 measure when
the rest of the song is in 6/8.  In MIDI terms, this is equivalent
to one full cycle of the current timebase (e.g., for timebase 120, a
single beat, 120 ticks long).  Each track used should have its own
InitBeat.  This beat should not contain any note on/off data, sysex
dump data, Loop Begin/End events (Controllers 116 and/or 117), or
other non-Controller events.  It may, however, contain MetaEvents
such as text, copyrights, markers, program changes (normal or
Controller 112), and the like.

The InitBeat should contain any needed Controller 110, 111, 112, or
113 events needed to set up each track for the song.  It may also
contain other Controllers (pitch wheel, modulation, RPN/NRPN data,
etc.) as desired.  Keep in mind that you will need to repeat these
controller values at some point within the Master Loop if you change
them at any point in the song (and you rely on the original values
when the song goes back to the Master Start point).

If no special handling is required for a track (i.e., the track is
to be played by all instruments and no Controller resets/setups are
desired), the InitBeat for that track may be left blank.  It is
advisable, however, to at least insert a single Controller 110 event
with value 127, indicating that the track is to be played by all
instruments.  This is more a matter of personal preference, but it
can come in handy for setting up templates with Cakewalk Pro for
Windows and other programs that support default song templates.

If none of the tracks in a song require any special handling, all
InitBeats may be left blank.  Do not delete the InitBeat measure -
just leave it blank.

Controller events may be spread throughout the InitBeat as desired.
You may place them all on a single tick, or on separate ticks.  Some
instruments will behave unpredictably if all events for a track are
placed on the same tick (e.g., the 5-6 events needed to adjust pitch
bend parameters, especially if controllers 100 and 101 are set with
value 0 and then reset with value 127 as recommended by Roland), so
composer discretion is advised.  At this time, simultaneous events
across multiple tracks are not known to cause a problem.

The InitBeat may be inserted in any way desired.  If you are using
Cakewalk Pro for Windows, it is simplest to make the first measure a
1/4 measure (one beat @ 4 per measure) and then switch the meter to
whatever you want to use for the remainder of the song right at
measure 2.  Meter changes within the song are not affected by this,
of course.
